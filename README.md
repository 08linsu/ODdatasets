datasets for outlier detection
All datasets have been downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Most of these data sets are used for the evaluation of classification and clustering methods. By contrast, for the evaluation of outlier detection, there are very few existing data sets. Accordingly, all these datasets were obtained by using the downsampling method for evaluating outlier detection.
